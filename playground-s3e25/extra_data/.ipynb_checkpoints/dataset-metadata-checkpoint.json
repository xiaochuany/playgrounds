In this study, I proposed a machine, or statistical, learning approach to predict hardness in naturally occurring materials, which integrates atomic and electronic features from composition directly across a wide variety of mineral compositions and crystal systems.

The database is composed of 369 uniquely named minerals. Due to the presence of multiple composition combinations for minerals referred to by the same name, the first step was to perform compositional permutations on these minerals.
